Control RGBW Lights via E131 (xlights or vixen)
## These lights have firmware written specifically for them:

Zemismart 6" RGBW Downlight: https://amzn.to/34MiRF7
Firmware: https://github.com/thehookup/E131-MQTT-RGBW-Lights/blob/master/E131_MQTT_Zemismart_CONFIGURE.ino

Lohas RGB-CCT Bulb: https://amzn.to/33GPkv2
Firmware: https://github.com/thehookup/E131-MQTT-RGBW-Lights/blob/master/E131RGBW_MQTT_Lohas_CONFIGURE.ino

Novostella RGB-CCT Flood Lights: https://amzn.to/2rV1zak
Firmware: https://github.com/thehookup/E131-MQTT-RGBW-Lights/blob/master/E131RGBW_MQTT_Novostella.ino

Firmware is uploaded for the Sonoff B1, I highly recommend using the Lohas instead, they are cheaper and have better white and color performance.
